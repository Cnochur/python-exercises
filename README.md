# python-exercises

A collection of beginner friendly projects I have completed within the past few days. This is giving me a way to help grasp programming fundamentals. 

Within in the series I have started to learn how to store data files (txt,csv) locally in order to have some kind of "database". I say this in quotes as from my next project (T-Quizzil [a cyber security based quiz game]), I hope to have included an actual database.

Ill add README files to each project some time in the future.

Within in the series I have started to learn how to store data files (txt,csv,json) locally in order to have some kind of "database". I say this in quotes as from my next project (t-quizzil [a cyber security quiz game]), I hope to have included an actual database.

Ill add README files to each project some time in the future.

Current project: T-Quizzil

UPDATE 1:

The repo 'quiz' was my intial thoughts on how to approach the game with a SQLite3 database included. After the intial commit of the project i realised that i need to understand using classes better. I decided to restart the project. Complete it without a database first then add one later.

Repo 'quiz2' will contain the new 'T-Quizzil' project.

UPDATE 1.1

Afetr stumping on how to generate 50 questions for each category easily, I went to google for the solution. From there I found https://quizapi.io/ and the solution became clear because I can practice working with apis again. Another advantage is the number of questions available for each topic.

With this a changes are happening to the topic choices from; Networking, Python, CySec Basics -> Linux, MySQL, Python. These changes will also help me as I am learning all three topics.
