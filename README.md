# python-exercises

A collection of beginner friendly projects I have completed within the past few days. This is giving me a way to help grasp programming fundamentals. 

Within in the series I have started to learn how to store data files (txt,csv) locally in order to have some kind of "database". I say this in quotes as from my next project (T-Quizzil [a cyber security based quiz game]), I hope to have included an actual database.

Ill add README files to each project some time in the future.

If you are actually reading this, firstly, thank you. Secondly, any advice is welcome.

UPDATE 1:

The repo 'quiz' was my intial thoughts on how to approach the game with a SQLite3 database included. After the intial commit of the project i realised that i need to understand using classes better. I decided to restart the project. Complete it without a database first then add one later.

Repo 'quiz2' will contain the new 'T-Quizzil' project.
