# python-exercises

A collection of beginner friendly projects I have completed within the past few days. This is giving me a way to help grasp programming fundamentals. 

Within in the series I have started to learn how to store data files (txt,csv,json) locally in order to have some kind of "database". I say this in quotes as from my next project (quizzir[a cyber security quiz game]), I hope to have included an actual database.

Ill add README files to each project some time in the future.

If you are actually reading this, firstly, thank you. Secondly, any advice is welcome.
