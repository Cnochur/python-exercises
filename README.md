# python-exercises

A collection of beginner friendly projects I have completed within the past few days. This is giving me a way to help grasp programming fundamentals. 

Within in the series I have started to learn how to store data files (txt,csv,json) locally in order to have some kind of "database". I say this in quotes as from my next project (t-quizzil [a cyber security quiz game]), I hope to have included an actual database.

Ill add README files to each project some time in the future.

Current project: T-Quizzil

If you are actually reading this, welcome and thank you.
