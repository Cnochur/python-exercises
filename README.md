# python-exercises

A collection of beginner friendly projects I have completed (Working on). This is giving me a way to help grasp programming fundamentals. 

Within in the series I have started to learn how to store data files (txt,csv) locally in order to have some kind of "database".

Ill add README files to each project some time in the future.

Current project: T-Quizzil

To-dos:

- error handling for answer options
- export to csv: name, difficulty, score, date?
- add main menu: display scores, play quiz
- display scores: get and display scores from csv
