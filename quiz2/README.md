After jumping ahead of my self and trying to introduce a database to a project, I took a step back and went back to understanding 
Object Orientated Programming (OOP).
The project is a collaboration of me, chatGPT and google. Although chatGPT did help me quite a bit I also found
2 great write ups, at which i read last night and again today.

Links - Classes = https://realpython.com/python-classes/
      - OOP     = https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/

I now understand a lot more about the 4 pillars of OOP; Encapsulation, Inheritence, Abstraction and Polymorphism. Heres a 
quote from the OOP document which really simplified it for me:

   "OOP in Python revolves around four main concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. 
    Encapsulation bundles data with methods, inheritance lets you create subclasses, abstraction hides complex details, 
    and polymorphism allows for different implementations."


Taking this into account, i combed over the code to help me understand it better. How to implement classes, instanciating
an object of that class, instance and class attributes, defining class functions and using the object methods.

To-Do
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Randomise correct_answer position.

When I call for the questions on linux, most of the correct answers end up as the first option. I think to resolve this, 
I need to randomise the order in which they are placed when being displayed on screen. 

2 - Add Database

Add a database so that the players name, score, topic and time can be stored and displayed.
